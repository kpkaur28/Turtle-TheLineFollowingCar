1. Designed and built an autonomous toy car that used an OpenMV camera (microcontroller) to precisely follow a course of 367 feet long track marked by 1‚Äù-wide white tape in random configuration in about 8.4 seconds.

2. Developed PCB design for the electronic circuitry using components like resistors, capacitors, transistors, mosfets, LEDs, and other ICs for the motor control of vehicle powered by single lithium battery. Developed data logging acquisition and transmission program in Python for OpenMV Camera and also experimented with various line detection algorithms.
